### Connect a chess engine

You can play chess-tui with any UCI compatible chess engines. To do so you will need to use the -e command to give the chess engine binary path.

Example:

```bash
chess-tui -e /your/bin/path
```

Here I installed stockfish using homebrew and gave chess-tui the path the the engine binary.
This command will store in your home directory the chess engine path so you don't have to relink it everytime !

### Configuration

Chess-tui uses a TOML configuration file located at `~/.config/chess-tui/config.toml`. Here are the available configuration options:

```toml
# Path to the chess engine binary
engine_path = "/path/to/engine"

# Display mode: "DEFAULT" or "ASCII"
display_mode = "DEFAULT"

# Logging level: "Off", "Error", "Warn", "Info", "Debug", "Trace"
log_level = "Off"
```

#### Configuration Options:

- **engine_path**: Path to your UCI-compatible chess engine binary
- **display_mode**:
  - `DEFAULT`: Uses unicode chess pieces
  - `ASCII`: Uses ASCII characters for pieces
- **log_level**: Controls the verbosity of logging
  - `Off`: No logging (default)
  - `Error`: Only errors
  - `Warn`: Warnings and errors
  - `Info`: General information, warnings and errors
  - `Debug`: Debugging information
  - `Trace`: Very verbose debugging information

The config file is automatically created when you first run chess-tui. You can manually edit it to customize your experience.

Base config:
```toml
# no engine path
display_mode = "DEFAULT"
log_level = "Off"
```
