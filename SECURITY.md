## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Chess-TUI, **please do NOT open a public GitHub issue**. Public issues may expose technical details before a fix is available.

### How to Report

You can report security issues in one of the following ways:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**  
   Use the “Security” → “Advisories” section of this repository to submit a private security report.

2. **Email**  
   Send a detailed report to:  
   `thomasmauran@yahoo.com`  

Please include in your report:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected version(s)
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

## Response Timeline

We aim to acknowledge all reports within **72 hours**. After verification, we will:
- Coordinate with the reporter on disclosure details
- Prepare and release a fix
- Update this policy if needed

We will work with you on disclosure timing so that fixes can be published before public details.

## Responsible Disclosure

By reporting issues through the channels above, you agree to:
- Not publicly disclose the vulnerability before a fix is published
- Cooperate with maintainers to validate and patch the issue

## After a Fix is Released

Once a security fix is ready:
- We will publish release notes for the fixed version
- We encourage users to update promptly
- Credit for discoverers may be given, unless anonymity was requested
