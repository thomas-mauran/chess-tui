# Introduction

In this section we will go through the project architecture and the different classes that compose the project.

The goal here is not to have a detailled description of each method and variable but rather a global overview of how things work since it would be too much work to keep this up to date.

If you wanna have a really detailled code oriented documentation you can always check the code itself or the [Doc RS](https://docs.rs/chess-tui/1.4.0/chess_tui/) directly.

Hopefully this will help you understand the project better and maybe even contribute to it !
